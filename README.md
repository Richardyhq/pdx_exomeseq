## Summary

Patient derived xenograft (PDX) models were derived from primary and metastatic
tumors from patients admitted to Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center with 
pancreatic adenocarcinoma. The PDX models and tumor samples were whole exome
sequenced (WES) to determine how the mutations from primary tissue and metastases 
propagate or evolve. The following repository outlines the analysis pipeline.

This is a tumor-only analysis, there were no pooled or patient-matched normal
samples available.
